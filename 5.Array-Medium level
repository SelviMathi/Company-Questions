1.Sort an array of 0s 1s and 2s
Problem Statement: Given an array consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Write a program to in-place sort the array without using inbuilt sort functions. ( Expected: Single pass-O(N) and constant space)
Example
Input:
 nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output:
[0,0,1,1,2,2]

2.2sum problem
Two Sum : Check if a pair with given sum exists in Array
Input : N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 14
Output: YES

3.Majority element
Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, write a program to return an element that occurs more than N/2 times in the given array. You may consider that such an element always exists in the array.
Example :
Input : N = 3, nums[] = {3,2,3}
Output: 3

4.Max subarray sum
Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which
has the largest sum and returns its sum and prints the subarray.
Example :
Input:
 arr = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] 
Output:
 6 
Explanation:
 [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. 


5.Spiral matrix:
Problem Statement: Given a Matrix, print the given matrix in spiral order.
Example:
Input: Matrix[][] = { { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
		      { 5, 6, 7, 8 },
		      { 9, 10, 11, 12 },
	              { 13, 14, 15, 16 } }

Outhput: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10.

6.Set Matrix Zero
Problem Statement: Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix.
Example:
Input:
 matrix=[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output:
 [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]


 7.Leaders in array
 Problem Statement: Given an array, print all the elements which are leaders. A Leader is an element that is greater than all of the elements on its right side in the array.
Example :
Input:
arr = [4, 7, 1, 0]
Output:
 7 1 0

 8.Next permutation
 Problem Statement: Given an array Arr[] of integers, rearrange the numbers of the given array into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange to the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
Example  :
Input format:
 Arr[] = {1,3,2}
Output: Arr[] = {2,1,3}

9.Count Subarray sum Equals K
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals k.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

10.Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array
Problem Statement: You are given an array of ‘N’ integers. You need to find the length of the longest sequence which contains the consecutive elements.
Example 1:
Input:
 [100, 200, 1, 3, 2, 4]
Output:
 4
