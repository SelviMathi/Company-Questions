1.Largest element in array
Problem Statement: Given an array, we have to find the largest element in the array.
Example :
Input:
 arr[] = {2,5,1,3,0};
Output:
 5

2.Second largest element in array
Problem Statement: Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array. Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.
Example 1:
Input:
 [1,2,4,7,7,5]
Output:
Second Smallest : 2
Second Largest : 5

3.Missing number in array
Problem Statement: Given an integer N and an array of size N-1 containing N-1 numbers between 1 to N. Find the number(between 1 to N), that is not present in the given array.
Example :
Input :
 N = 5, array[] = {1,2,4,5}
Output:
 3

4.Check array is sorted
Problem Statement: Given an array of size n, write a program to check if the given array is sorted in (ascending / Increasing / Non-decreasing) order or not. If the array is sorted then return True, Else return False.
Note: Two consecutive equal values are considered to be sorted.
Example :
Input:
 N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output:
True.

5.Remove duplicates
Problem Statement: Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
If there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of the array should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
Note: Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of the array.
Example :
Input:
 arr[1,1,2,2,2,3,3]
Output:
 arr[1,2,3,_,_,_,_]

6.Left Rotate   
Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, left rotate the array by one place.
Example:
Input:
 N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output:
 2,3,4,5,1

7.Move zeroes to end
Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.
Example:
Input:
 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output:
 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0

8.Linear search
Problem Statement: Given an array, and an element num the task is to find if num is present in the given array or not. If present print the index of the element or print -1.
Example :
Input: arr[]= 1 2 3 4 5, num = 3
Output: 2

9.Problem Statement: Given two sorted arrays, arr1, and arr2 of size n and m. Find the union of two sorted arrays.
The union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays.NOTE: Elements in the union should be in ascending order.
Example :
Input:
n = 5,m = 5.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5}  
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5}
Output:
 {1,2,3,4,5}

10.Problem Statement: Given an array and a sum k, we need to print the length of the longest subarray that sums to k.
Example :
Input: N = 3, k = 5, array[] = {2,3,5}
Output: 2
